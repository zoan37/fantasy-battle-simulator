## Fantasy Battle Simulator

Fantasy Battle Simulator lets you battle enemies of your imagination in a fantasy world, as the Hero blessed with an overpowered magic system. It is currently mainly in a text adventure format, but with image generation and music playing for more immersiveness.

Uses OpenRouter for LLMs, Fal for image generation, and Suno for music. Deployed on Vercel.
